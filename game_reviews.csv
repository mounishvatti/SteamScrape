The game has fallen deeper into the depths, and for some reason, the experience with CS2 is even worse than the old version. Let me explain:1. The  placement matches are full of russians and well we all know what that means. Its so bad that its mostly not playable. 2. Cheaters. There is a lot of them.I really cant think a reason why to play this.;Not Recommended;282;2,006.8 ;

Valve Is the 2nd most garbage company next to Blizzard in any customer related support issue. The cheating in this game is just as bad as CSGO, and considering that the cheating was the biggest issue of CSGO, you'd think they would fix it when releasing the same f#$%#% game after 10 years... In fact, the solution is very easy to set up, but no, Valve are a bunch of idiots that allow the cheating industry flourish with their game. Almost as Unreal as Blizzard looking for ways to clean the money of their users instead of releasing new content. This was a quick uninstall after 3 games and 2 having hackers ruin the game. My best advise is stay away from this game.;Not Recommended;545;454.6 ;

CS2 is an impressive demonstration of the potential of the Source 2 engine. It offers a distinct and novel experience of the Counter Strike series, which I find appealing and refreshing.

CS2 is an impressive demonstration of the potential of the Source 2 engine. It offers a distinct and novel experience of the Counter Strike series, which I find appealing and refreshing.

"Counter Strike 2 is basically a good game and I usually enjoy playing this game, but it also has strong weaknesses.The anticheat system provided by ""valve"" is so bad that many players switch to third party servers such as ""faceit.com"" because they have significantly fewer or no cheaters.In addition, it would be better to replace a player who has left the game with another player in order to compensate for the resulting disadvantage for the team, instead of letting the team play with one less player.All in all you can love the game but hate it at the same time.In my opinion, fixing the critique mentioned above would lead to a better gaming experience and fun.";Recommended;551;109.7 ;

In the revered arenas of CS:GO, where every flick shot is a testament to skill and strategy, I embarked on a quest as ambitious as a defuse under fire: the search for the elusive 'nude mod.' With the determination of a CT guarding the bomb site and the precision of a T executing a well-coordinated rush, I scoured every corner of the virtual battlegrounds in hopes of uncovering pixels stripped of their digital garments.Yet, like a failed rush against a fortified defense, my efforts yielded no fruit. No matter how many crates I opened or how many custom servers I explored, the promise of nudity remained out of reach.However, amidst the disappointment, I discovered something far more valuable: the sense of camaraderie shared among players, the exhilaration of clutching a round in the face of adversity, and the sheer joy of immersion in the vibrant CS:GO community.While the game may lack in pixelated nudity, it more than compensates with the thrill of competition and the bonds formed through teamwork and shared experiences.

Great game, based on teamwork and skill.;Recommended;34;42.1 ;
"Held off on playing, because I hate Alpha/Beta/Prerelease games....have played this for 2 weeks now (almost 5 months after release). WARNING: The game IS still ALPHA/BETA/PRERELEASE, so the review reflects that.This is a huge complaint, because one of my all time favourite games have been ruined.Comparing to CS:GO:  - Servers are overloaded and slow as hell (i guess it's the tickless servers, which, the 128 ones, only silvers ever noticed to be a problem), and it is so much worse....I play sometimes with an awp, and now if I saw someone jump across somewhere, crosshair is two lightyears away from the player, I still shoot, because 50% of the time, the kill is STILL registered, and they die. Of course, the same happens to me, and I have peeked and after a second tried running, but no, the game decides, that that bullet, that he shot one year after I had already left, connected with my head, and I die (of course, because the servers truly are tickless - their ticks can now be called every-second-game-checks, because that's how frequent the server updates are)  - Premier is dogcrap, (1) EVERY SINGLE game (no exceptions, have played now 23, every single one of them) someone leaves the game (atleast 1, from either team. Lucky if it's the opponent's). (2) The game gives zero hoots about ranks - one friend recieves LEM in Wingman, the other, playing with him, having MORE kills, recieves Silver 4...nice ranking, he ain't playing Wingman ever again bc of that (Rank ups take like a million games between ranks) and so won't I. (3) The game gives THE TEAM points for winning. If you have 4k DAM, while others barely hit 1k, if you lose, you lose points - sad for you, I guess, if the game RNG'ed your trash team. Now I mostly play with a 3/4 stack, or else I can just not play.  - The game itself runs badly - GO on my RTX 3060/R5 5600x didn't run 500fps, but I comfortably ran my 144hz monitor with no stutters, ever, highest details, while CS2 barely hits 100fps, while everything is off in background (browser, Teams, everything), with Graphics on low, except Shadows (you just handicap yourself with bad shadows) which are on High (not Very High) and CONSTANTLY stutters. Maybe the servers are at fault, don't know, don't care, GO never had this problem. Also, the game itself recommends All High settings....HAHAHAHA, so I get 30fps? No thank you, tried that, and that experience was crap.  - Constant crashes on older cards (myb a 1050 is ancient now, and graphics demand that....if that's the reason, fine, I guess, sad for poorer people though)  - Teleporting players, suddenly appear in front of you, insta kills you (of course, I am stuttering, they most likely do not, so they play fine)  - Ping is the same, atleast that hasn't been effed up   - Can't play CS:GO....why? Because the new one has a few more inspect animations? Hate it. Wouldn't cry about this, if I could still play my #3 all time favourite game. F me, I guess.Tl;dr;The game is very far from being smooth, stable, far from optimized (both gameplay and engine), let alone e-sports as it once was.If you (Valve) fix this, then maybe the review will change, but right now this game makes me rage every time I play it, which is sad, because I play this game to relax after work. Also, I hate you for deleting GO. No Arms Race until 4mo later....nice Prerelease, thank you for the ""new and improved"" GO.";Not Recommended;2784;787.1 ;

The game is very easy to play but very difficult to master. It has a wide range of skins, maps, etc. It will not be enjoyable if you are horrible at the game because you will get nowhere however, if you have a little bit of skill you will have fun playing cs2. Although there are problems with the anti cheat such as it saying you have no signatures on your files which in that case you have to reboot the entire game.;Recommended;336;11.9 ;

The game is very easy to play but very difficult to master. It has a wide range of skins, maps, etc. It will not be enjoyable if you are horrible at the game because you will get nowhere however, if you have a little bit of skill you will have fun playing cs2. Although there are problems with the anti cheat such as it saying you have no signatures on your files which in that case you have to reboot the entire game.;Recommended;336;11.9 ;

It's a different style of FPS and SnD, took a couple hundreds hours to get used to it. I would highly recommend it and if you do buy, get prime as well.

Very disappointing csgo was peek but valorant is better then this.Lack of Innovation:CSGO 2 suffers from a severe lack of innovation. Rather than building upon the foundation established by the original game, it merely recycles existing mechanics and features without introducing anything truly groundbreaking. Players are left feeling like they're playing an outdated version of CSGO rather than experiencing a fresh, evolved gameplay experience.Stagnant Gameplay:One of the most disappointing aspects of CSGO 2 is its stagnant gameplay. Despite the passage of time and advancements in gaming technology, the core mechanics remain virtually unchanged. This refusal to evolve results in a sense of repetitiveness and monotony, ultimately alienating longtime fans who were expecting a more dynamic and engaging sequel.Technical Issues:From server instability to rampant bugs and glitches, CSGO 2 is plagued by numerous technical issues that hinder the overall gaming experience. Frequent crashes, connectivity problems, and performance inconsistencies frustrate players and undermine any enjoyment they might derive from the game. These issues reflect a lack of thorough testing and optimization, indicating rushed development or negligence on the part of the developers.Monetization Practices:CSGO 2 adopts predatory monetization practices that prioritize profit over player satisfaction. The introduction of pay-to-win elements, loot boxes, and other exploitative mechanics tarnishes the integrity of the game and fosters a sense of distrust within the community. Instead of fostering a fair and competitive environment, these practices create an uneven playing field and discourage players from investing their time and money in the game.Conclusion:In conclusion, CSGO 2 falls short of expectations and fails to deliver an experience worthy of its predecessor's legacy. With its lack of innovation, stagnant gameplay, technical issues, and exploitative monetization practices, it represents a step backward rather than a step forward for the franchise. Unless significant improvements are made, it's difficult to recommend CSGO 2 to fans of the series or competitive gamers looking for a compelling gaming experience.;Not Recommended;1906;15.5 ;

Hey fellow gamers, let me vent about CS2 for a moment. I mean, seriously, have you guys tried moving in this game? It's like trying to dance with two left feet. The movement is just clunky and lacks the finesse we had in the good old days of CSGO. No more elegant pixel surfs or precision jumps – it's just run, jump, and hope for the best.And don't even get me started on the fluidity we had in CSGO. The movement in that game was like a well-choreographed ballet, allowing for seamless transitions between actions. CS2 feels more like stomping around in clown shoes.;Recommended;465;4,174.2 ;

CSGO was a great game, tons of maps, skins, and the buy menu had every single weapon in the gameAfter CS2 was released, many of the maps weren't deleted which would be fine if the developers were to bring those maps back, but it has been aboyt 5-6 months and there has been little to no changes or things from CSGO that haven't been brought backAlso the new buy menu causes problems because it doesn't have every single weapon limiting your options;Not Recommended;367;199.4 ;
I've been playing Counter Strike since it was a beta (off and on).  The cheating is OUT OF CONTROL!  Do not play this game until they address the cheating problem.  Every other game I'm getting killed by cheaters, lost 2,000 ELO from blatant cheaters.  I'm not talking about, this guy is good, I'm talking they go fool on blatant by end of the game.  This sucks!  So disappointed that they refuse to address this issue.;Not Recommended;339;1,644.5 ;

Hey fellow gamers, let me vent about CS2 for a moment. I mean, seriously, have you guys tried moving in this game? It's like trying to dance with two left feet. The movement is just clunky and lacks the finesse we had in the good old days of CSGO. No more elegant pixel surfs or precision jumps – it's just run, jump, and hope for the best.And don't even get me started on the fluidity we had in CSGO. The movement in that game was like a well-choreographed ballet, allowing for seamless transitions between actions. CS2 feels more like stomping around in clown shoes.;Recommended;465;4,174.2 ;

Don't bother playing it until Valve implements a functional anti-cheat.The current one doesn't work (if it's even enabled at all).There's easily 25% of the playerbase hacking, a bunch more buying boosting services of those hackers and that leaves much too little actual players who want to play and improve themselves.;Not Recommended;269;1,502.2 ;

If u ever feel like you want to die, but you are not 100% sure, then u should play cs :D. after playing it for few hours u feel like you would kill every man in russia bc of their good quality headphones and mics. After losing 1v5 situation there is a pretty big change that your teammates will get angry at you, while they are bottom fragging. But in conclusion i would give it a 9/10. Oh and after you open your first case you will be addicted instantly and there is no coming back from that.;Not Recommended;397;129.9 ;

I highly ask you to do something about cheaters. Counter-strike is an old game with a huge audience but right now it has more cheaters than other fps games. As far as I truly love CS, if you won't do anything about cheaters, I'm going to delete the game and ask for a refund. I can other fps games instead of this and get more fun. I don't want to feel toxic each game because of cheaters. And sorry stop lying like you do care about cheaters. For years you have done nothing about fixing this problem.

(This is my first time reviewing a game so please don't judge the game too hard after reading this) Counter-Strike 2 is pretty much the only game I play on Steam as of now. Would 100% recommend. The player-base is still solid after the switch over from CS:GO. Prime upgrade is pretty much a must-have if you want to enjoy the game. I've had prime now for a couple months and even though the competition is higher, there are few to no cheaters in my lobbies. Cheaters aside, there is a fairly sharp learning curve to this game, but after some practice it becomes a great game to play. The Steam market for CS-2 is also another interesting aspect that I've only dabbled in by selling the weekly cases for a little money to buy skins. If you enjoy team vs. team, somewhat skilled games, this is an easy must-have.;Recommended;661;454.0 ;
very good game and fun to play. But i hope that more maps will be coming out soon, becouse it is getting kind of boring playing the same maps over and over. So i personally decited to hop on other games for a while.;Recommended;172;166.9 ;

(This is my first time reviewing a game so please don't judge the game too hard after reading this) Counter-Strike 2 is pretty much the only game I play on Steam as of now. Would 100% recommend. The player-base is still solid after the switch over from CS:GO. Prime upgrade is pretty much a must-have if you want to enjoy the game. I've had prime now for a couple months and even though the competition is higher, there are few to no cheaters in my lobbies. Cheaters aside, there is a fairly sharp learning curve to this game, but after some practice it becomes a great game to play. The Steam market for CS-2 is also another interesting aspect that I've only dabbled in by selling the weekly cases for a little money to buy skins. If you enjoy team vs. team, somewhat skilled games, this is an easy must-have.;Recommended;661;454.0 ;
very good game and fun to play. But i hope that more maps will be coming out soon, becouse it is getting kind of boring playing the same maps over and over. So i personally decited to hop on other games for a while.;Recommended;172;166.9 ;

This was once a good free-to-play, pick me up game. It isn't anymore.If you decide to download this, you will be teamed with or against many cheaters in the game. This game isn't competitive anymore. Prime/non-prime players with cheats. There's too much at question now for this to be a legit game.It'll come down to patience... how much patience do you have to deal with cheaters who you can indeed report, but with the simple fact that Valve will do nothing about it. My patience is up with just 980 hours of game time. Maybe I'll visit it again someday, but for now, it's going to be uninstalled.;Not Recommended;492;980.3 ;

Title: CS2: A Disappointing SequelRating: ★☆☆☆☆As a longtime fan of the original CS game, I was eagerly anticipating CS2. However, my excitement quickly turned to disappointment upon playing it.Firstly, the graphics are a massive step backward. While the original CS had a gritty and immersive aesthetic, CS2 feels like a cheap knockoff with bland textures and uninspired character designs. It's as if the developers put no effort into updating the visuals for a modern audience.The gameplay mechanics are also lackluster. Controls are clunky and unresponsive, making it frustrating to navigate the game world. The AI of enemies is laughably bad, often standing still or running into walls instead of posing any real challenge. It's clear that little thought went into refining the gameplay experience.Furthermore, the story is nonsensical and poorly written. Unlike the original CS, which had a gripping narrative that kept you engaged from start to finish, CS2's plot feels like a disjointed mess with gaping plot holes and underdeveloped characters. It's impossible to become emotionally invested in the story when everything feels so poorly executed.To add insult to injury, CS2 is riddled with bugs and glitches. From game-breaking crashes to physics-defying animations, it's clear that the developers rushed the release without properly testing it. It's unacceptable to release a game in such a broken state, and it shows a blatant disregard for the players who spent their hard-earned money on it.Overall, CS2 is a massive disappointment and a stain on the legacy of the original CS. It fails to capture the magic of its predecessor and instead serves as a reminder of everything that can go wrong with a sequel. Save your money and steer clear of this trainwreck of a game.;Not Recommended;1498;14.8 ;
